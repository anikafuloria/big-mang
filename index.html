                        <div id="stepdesc">
                            We conducted need-finding interviews with three individuals with disabilities and 
                            one hiring manager to gain a deeper understanding of various disabilities in the workplace. After these conversations, we gained further insight by creating empathy maps. <br><BR>
                            Our initial findings suggested that people with invisible disabilities may sometimes be perceived as more of a liability than people with visible disabilities,
                            and people with invisible disabilities may be hesitant to disclose their disability, which can limit access to accommodations. <br><br>

                        <div id="stepdesc">
                            Our initial need-finding encouraged us to dive deeper into the work experiences of people with invisible disabilities. <BR>
                                We conducted three aditional interviews with disabled past interns and one with a director of professional development at a large disability network. <BR>
                                <br>Two consistent themes that we learned from our conversations were that 1) our interviewees often chose not to disclose their disability 
                                and ask for accommodations because they felt it would be a burden to employers, and 2) although the foundation of a clearly accessible 
                                and inclusive working environment is managerial empathy, empathy is incredibly difficult to teach. With these painpoints in mind, we began 
                                brainstorming solution directions by using the "How might we?" framework (e.g. "HMW help employers see the humanity of disabled employees before 
                                their disability?").<br><BR>
                                Our HMW-inspired solutions included arranging platonic dates between managers and employees, creating a chatbot that can help streamline asking 
                                for accommodations, etc. <BR><br>Finally, we tested three of our solution ideas using basic experience prototypes (e.g. a Google Form to simulate 
                                a platonic date matching process) and tentatively settled on our platonic dates solution to help increase empathy between disabled employees and 
                                employers.

                                 To maximize our impact on a specific group and based on our need-finding interviews, we decided to focus on building a tool with 
                                 people who have bipolar disorder. We brainstormed three core tasks that our story-sharing tool, coined "Polarity", can support. 
                                 We storyboarded three tasks and created the below concept video to demonstrate the affordances of Polarity.<BR><BR>

                            It's time to start designing! Using our three user tasks, we started sketching different design ideas. We even sketched non-conventional solutions based in VR/AR, haptic wearables. <BR>
                                We settled on a mobile app solution because it is widely available and accessible. One way we tried to design Polarity to directly serve users with bipolar disorder was by adding emotion tags 
                                and unique filters to help users search for relevant stories. We turned our sketches into a low-fidelity Figma tool, and tested it with four users. 
                                We collected both process (qualitative) and bottom-line (quantitative) data from our users. <BR><BR>

                            Before building our final high-fidelity prototype, the entire CS 147 class performed heuristic evaluations on another design team's medium-fi prototype.
